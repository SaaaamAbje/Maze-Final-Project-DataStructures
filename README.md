# Maze-Final-Project-DataStructures
A 13×13 maze navigation project using a DFS-inspired stack algorithm. The navigator tracks movements, backtracks using stack pops at dead ends, and explores all reachable paths. A Navigator Class handles movement and detection, while a Camera Class renders the maze in real time.
